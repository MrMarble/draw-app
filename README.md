# Draw-App :pencil2:

This is a simple drawing app made with React.js and VanillaJS. **PWA** Compatible! :tada:

## Documentation :pencil:

I have use Docz to documentate the project, you can check it out here: https://docs-draw-app.now.sh/

## Live version

I've hosted a version on https://draw-app.now.sh/ so you can play with it right away without needing to download and build the project

## How to

If you want to build your own version you'll need Yarn. This commands may help you out.

```bash
yarn start # Launch a development server
yarn test # Launches all jest tests
yarn test:coverage # Show the coverage of all files
yarn build # Creates production version
yarn docz:dev # Launch a development Docz server
```

### Notes

This version does not use any kind of Lazy Brush so the drawing experience is a bit rough, I may implement something in the future to accomplish that.
